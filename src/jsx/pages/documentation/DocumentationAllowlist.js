                    <h3>Overview and Motivation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Small companies often have statutory transfer restrictions in place. As
                        they grow, they typically tend to get rid of these restrictions and
                        abandon them entirely once they are publicly traded. This allowlist
                        implementation is designed to flexibly and efficiently accompany the
                        company on this journey. It is possible to have freely transferrable
                        tokens and tokens that are subject to the allowlisting in parallel,
                        thereby supporting an incremental path from a completely controlled state
                        to freely transferrable token with a gradually increasing free float. If
                        necessary, the process also can be reverted again.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Address Types</h3>
                    <p>Generally, there are four types of addresses:</p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li>
                            Allowlisted addresses that can receive tokens from anyone, but only send
                            to allowlisted or powerlisted addresses.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Powerlisted addresses are like allowlisted addresses, but implicitely
                            turn target addresses into allowlisted addresses, such that they can de
                            facto transfer to anyone. The null address is powerlisted by default,
                            ensuring that no explicit allowlisting is needed when minting tokens and
                            that new tokens are not free float.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Forbidden addresses that cannot receive tokens from anyone, but can send
                            them to allowlisted or powerlisted addresses.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Free addresses that can send to free, allowlisted, and powerlisted
                            addresses, but can only receive from other free addresses. This is the
                            default for new addresses.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Token Types</h3>
                    <p>
                        We distinguish between two token types, whereas their type depends on the
                        address they reside on:
                    </p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li>Restricted tokens that can only be sent to allowlisted addresses</li>
                        <li>
                            Free float tokens that can be sent to any address except explicitely
                            forbidden ones
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The token type is not stored anywhere but implied by the address they
                        reside on. So a free float token becomes a restricted token if sent to an
                        allowlisted address! However, there is a function to suspend all
                        restrictions, making all tokens free float tokens.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Limited Free Float</h3>
                    <p>
                        The use-case of having a limited free float is somewhat extraordinary and
                        of special interest. Starting with all shares being restricted, a company
                        could start setting some selected addresses to the 'free' type, thereby
                        making the tokens on these addresses freely transferrable (at least until
                        they are transferred to an allowlisted address again). For example, a
                        company could declare all its treasury shares free float and then start
                        selling them while keeping transfer restrictions for the existing
                        shareholders in place.
