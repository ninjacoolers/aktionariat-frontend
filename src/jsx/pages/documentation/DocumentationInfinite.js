                        With ERC‑20 tokens, allowances are often set to “infinite” values so that
                        they only need to be set once for a given contract. This is safe under the
                        assumption that the target contract is written in a way that it can only
                        make use of the funds in a pre-determined manner. For example, Uniswap
                        sets the allowance by default to (2<sup>256</sup> - 1), which is the
                        maximum integer value supported by the Ethereum. Then, whenever Uniswap is
                        used to sell some of the approved tokens, this very high value is adjusted
                        and an event emitted. This works, but uses more gas than necessary given
                        the intended behaviour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since gas fees are higher than ever, we adjusted our default ERC‑20
                        contract to support “infinite” allowances. Whenever the allowance is set
                        to 2<sup>255</sup> or higher, the allowance is considered infinite and is
                        not decreased when used. This saves us a small, but not negligible amount
                        of gas on every transaction that makes use of the allowance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, we already save a little bit of gas when setting the value.
                        Initiating an allowance to (2<sup>256</sup> - 1) or
                        “0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff” in
                        hex costs 47′872 gas in the current version of Ethereum. Initiating an
                        allowance with (2<sup>255</sup>) or
                        “0x8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000” in
                        hex costs 45′888 gas because zeroes are cheaper than non-zero values in
                        the hex representation of the transaction payload. So we already save
                        about 4% when initiating the allowance just by choosing a better value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, with the smart contract recognizing “infinite” allowances, the
                        allowance does not need to be adjusted anymore when spent. Usually, a
                        transferFrom transaction costs about 48′024 gas, whereof the internal
                        execution costs are 23′744 gas. When skipping the allowance update in case
                        of an infinite allowance, this cost is reduced to about 40′677 gas,
                        whereof the internal execution costs are 16′397 gas. So this little trick
                        saves us 7′347 gas on most “transferFrom” method calls. At today’s Ether
                        and gas prices, this is about 1 CHF per invocation.

                        already has this feature built-in (with the value used by Uniswap) and
                        also never emits an Approval event to save a little more gas, bringing
                        down the costs of setting the allowance to about 43′935 gas.
